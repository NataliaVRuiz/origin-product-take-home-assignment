# Origin Product Take-Home Assignment

## The Assignment
Write an analysis of your *new* favorite product.

We expect you to go in-depth on at least the following questions:

- What is it?
- What it does and why do you love it?
- What are its top 1-2 features? Why? Why were they implemented? How would you measure their success?
- Same thing for the worst 1-2 features.
- How would you improve it? Why? Consider you'd have 2 months with 1 designer and 2 engineers.

## Criteria
We are looking for intellectually rigorous, relentless resourceful, detail-obsessed, customer-centric, technically excellent product leaders.

Given that you show those qualities in your analysis, you can deliver it in any form you like, as long as you use English. We'd prefer it if you send us a text file, but it's just that – a preference. If you'd rather do a PowerPoint presentation or a web page, go for it.

This assignment should be doable in less than one day. We expect you to learn fast, communicate with us, and make decisions regarding its implementation & scope to achieve the expected results on time.

Feel free to add mockups if it helps you during the process, but it is not necessary to build any-fidelity screens a user would interact with. We have a strong design team, so this won't be a part of your day-to-day.
